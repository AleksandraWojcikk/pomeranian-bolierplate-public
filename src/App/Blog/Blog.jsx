        Pop culture used to define a generation, but it seems the cultural,
        music and fashion trends of the 1990s have been recycled, and what
        Generation X considered its rite of passage into adulthood, is being
        discovered and claimed by fledgling grown-ups as their own. There's been
        the resurgence of vinyl as the trend-setters' choice of music
        consumption rather than the ease of a digital download, and now the
        hipsters have discovered the nostalgic sound of a whirring cassette from
        which to enjoy the dulcet tones of everyone from Salt-N-Pepa to Rick
        Astley.
